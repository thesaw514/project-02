### `Description`

Welcome to Project 02 of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree program. In this project, students are challenged to develop a browser-based card matching game that demonstrates their mastery (or current level) of JavaScript as well as HTML and CSS. The project as a whole makes use of a combination of HTML, CSS, JS, and some specialized dependencies (listed below).

### `Instructions`

The rules of gameplay are very simple: match any two particular cards of the same symbol randomly spreadout over the deck of sixteen cards. Each turn of a pair of cards counts as a move. Match all eight pairs and you win!

> *Hint: Matching card pairs in the least amount of moves will result in a higher **star** rating!*

### `How to Play`

To run the game - simply clone or download the project files to your local desktop and then open: *index.html*.
